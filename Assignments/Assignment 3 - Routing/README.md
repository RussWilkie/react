# Assignment Requirements

1)  Add Routes to load "Users" and "Courses" on different pages(by entering a URL, without links)
2)  Add a simple navigation with two links => One leading to "Users", one leading to "Course"
3)  Make the courses in "Courses" clickable by adding a link and load the "Course" component in place of "Courses"
(without passing any data for now)
4)  Pass the course ID to the "Course" page and output it there
5)  Pass the course title to the "Course" page - pass it as a param or score bonus by passing it as query
	params(you need to manually parse them though!)
6)  Load the "Course" component as nested component of "Courses"
7)  Add a 404 error page and render it for any unknown routes
8)  Redirect requests to /all-courses to /courses (=> Your "Courses" page)
